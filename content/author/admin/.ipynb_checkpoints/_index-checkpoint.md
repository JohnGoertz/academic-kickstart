As a post-doctoral researcher in the Stevens Group at Imperial College London, I am researching novel tools for precise intracellular biosensing and robust point-of-care diagnostics. This work takes advantage of unique phenomena occurring in nanostructured materials to answer fundamental questions in cell biology while enabling portable and easy-to-use diagnostic devices.
